Welcome 🙏! You've stumbled upon my personal repository of university course materials. I'm attempting to organize the chaos and share it as I go.

### Live Course Page

For a much prettier and more organized view of all this content, head over to the main course page:

**[https://ps-keerthana.github.io/CourseVault/](https://ps-keerthana.github.io/CourseVault/)**

### The Treasure 

Currently this course page hosts the notes, slides, and various digital scribbles for my courses:

* **Machine Learning** 
* **Computer Networks** (💀)
* **Operating Systems** 
* **Software Tools & Techniques** 
#### Believe it or not, this repository is scheduled to get even messier. More courses are on their way to join this glorious pile. I can't promise they'll be organized, but I can promise they'll be here... eventually. Stay tuned.

### A Note from Captain Obvious 🧐

The main course page links directly to the files stored in my other course-specific repositories.

**Heads up:** Some PDFs are massive. If GitHub says `Unable to render`, don't panic. Just hit the **"Download"** button and view it locally.


### ⚠️ Warning: Enter at Your Own Risk ⚠️

Think of this as a live archaeological dig. I'm constantly unearthing old notes and adding new ones. Things might be messy, incomplete, or mysteriously vanish, only to reappear later with more cryptic annotations.

*I make no guarantees about the accuracy of these notes, especially the ones uploaded at 3 AM when my brain was half asleep. Use them at your own risk.*

Happy studying... or at least, happy procrastinating by organizing your own notes better than I have!
